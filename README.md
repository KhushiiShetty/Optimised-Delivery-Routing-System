# Optimized Food Delivery Routing System

## Overview

This project implements an optimized food delivery routing system using Python, leveraging advanced programming concepts and data structures and algorithms (DSA). The system aims to enhance delivery efficiency by minimizing travel time and distance while considering various real-world constraints.

## Features

- **Efficient Route Calculation**: Utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search for optimal pathfinding in urban environments.
- **Dynamic Input Handling**: Supports real-time updates of delivery requests and traffic conditions.
- **Data Structures**: Employs graphs, priority queues, and other DSA techniques to manage routes and deliveries effectively.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple command-line or GUI interface for easy interaction with the system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x


## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-delivery-routing.git
   cd food-delivery-routing
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   To start the routing system, execute:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
## Purpose
This project was built as a project for the ECE241- Advanced programming class at UMass Amherst to better understand and implement DSA concepts in Python.
